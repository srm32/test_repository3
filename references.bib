abstract = {PURPOSE This study aimed to determine the effectiveness, safety, and oral intubation time (IT) using a retromolar Bonfils fiberoptic scope compared with a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty patients (16-60 years old, American Society of Anesthesiology I/II) scheduled for general anesthesia for elective ear-nose-throat and plastic surgery were randomly divided into a Bonfils group (Group B, n = 30) and a Macintosh group (Group M, n = 30). Exclusion criteria included Mallampati IV, thyromental distance ≤4 cm, mouth {\textless}4 cm, cervical spine problems, body mass index {\textgreater}35, sleep apnea, reflux esophagitis, coronary artery disease, intracranial vascular malformation, elevated intracranial pressure, bleeding disorders, allergies to planned drugs, and patient refusal. Mallampati scoring, mouth opening, and thyromental distance were used for airway assessment. The time needed for successful intubation (IT), number of attempts, number of failures, systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR) and Oxygen saturation (O2) and damage to the lips, dentures, and pharyngeal or laryngeal structures were recorded. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage. Chi-square tests and Student's t-tests were used to compare the groups. P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The groups were comparable regarding demographic data, preoperative airway parameters, IT, the number of attempts, O2, and the incidence of complications (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, Bonfils intubation was associated with more stable HR, SBP, DBP and MBP (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION The Bonfils fiberoptic scope is comparable to a Macintosh laryngoscope but assures better hemodynamic stability. In difficult cases, the Bonfils scope is a better choice because of its ability to navigate.},

abstract = {To examine the interaction of epidural anesthesia, coagulation status, and outcome after lower extremity revascularization, 80 patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease were prospectively randomized to receive general anesthesia combined with postoperative epidural analgesia (GEN-EPI) or general anesthesia with on-demand narcotic analgesia (GEN). Demographics did not differ between groups except that the GEN-EPI group had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus and of previous myocardial infarction. Coagulation status was monitored using thromboelastography. An additional 40 randomly selected patients without atherosclerotic vascular disease undergoing noncardiovascular procedures served as controls for coagulation status. Vascular surgical patients were hypercoagulable compared with control patients before operation and on the first postoperative day. Postoperatively, this hypercoagulability was attenuated in the GEN-EPI group and was associated with a lower incidence of thrombotic events (peripheral arterial graft coronary artery or deep vein thromboses). The rates of cardiovascular, infectious, and overall postoperative complications, as well as duration of intensive care unit stay, were significantly reduced in the GEN-EPI group. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that the only significant predictors of postoperative cardiovascular complications were preoperative congestive heart failure and general anesthesia without epidural analgesia. We conclude that in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease undergoing arterial reconstructive surgery (a) thromboelastographic evidence of increased platelet-fibrinogen interaction is associated with early postoperative thrombotic events, and (b) epidural anesthesia and analgesia is associated with beneficial effects on coagulation status and postoperative outcome compared with intermittent on-demand opioid analgesia.},
